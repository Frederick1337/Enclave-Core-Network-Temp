## 🚀 Developer Onboarding: Integrating with Project Enclave
Welcome to Project Enclave. This guide walks you through adapting, compiling, and deploying your own separate applications to use our Ring -1 bare-metal memory-shuffling ecosystem.
By following these steps, you can immunize any custom data structure or variable type in your program against memory scrapers, pointer scanners, and physical PCIe DMA sniffing cards with zero modifications required to the underlying hypervisor core.
------------------------------
## 🛠️ Step 1: Include the Interface Headers in Your Project
You do not write your application code inside our repository. Instead, simply copy the public interface files from our repository's common directory and drop them into your own separate project's source tree:

* Copy src/common/enclave_integration.h into your local project directory.
* Copy src/common/enclave_hypercall.h into your local project directory.

At the very top of your application's source code files (e.g., main.cpp or game_client.cpp), include the master templates to open the hypervisor communication channels:

#include "enclave_integration.h"#include "enclave_hypercall.h"#include <iostream>

------------------------------
## 🔒 Step 2: Establish the Early-Boot Attestation Handshake
Before your program loads any sensitive data, configuration matrices, or secret keys, you must query our running bare-metal hypervisor to ensure the local host machine is safe and virtualized. Add this validation loop right at the entry point of your program (main):

int main() {
    // Ping the Ring -1 VMM using Command Vector 0x01
    // Pass the master authorization token down to the CPU registers
    if (EnclaveHypercallGate::IssueHypercall(0x01, 0x55AAFJLOMBARDI) != 0xAA) {
        std::cerr << "[⚠️ FATAL] Environment Unsecure! Project Enclave Hypervisor is missing.\n";
        std::cerr << "Ensure the bare-metal kernel driver is loaded at boot before running this app.\n";
        std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE); 
    }
    
    std::cout << "[🛡️ SECURE] Enclave attestation passed. Initializing application enclaves...\n";
    
    // Your secure program logic goes here
    return 0;
}

------------------------------
## 🧬 Step 3: Wrap and Protect Your Variables
You are not limited to specific variable configurations. Because our SDK leverages standard C++ Templates, you can protect any data type (integers, text strings, coordinate vectors, or massive structural rows) automatically.
## 1. Define Any Custom Structure
Create your variables or object layouts exactly as you normally would:

struct GameServerData {
    uint32_t player_id;
    float position_x;
    float position_y;
    uint64_t cryptographic_auth_token;
};

## 2. Pass Your Structure into the Open Template Slot
Instead of instantiating a naked, static variable in RAM, drop your data type inside the angled brackets < > of our ProtectedVariable template. Bound it to the hypervisor core to engage the Dynamic Namespace Variable Switching Engine:

// Instantiate your baseline data objectGameServerData raw_data = { 9012, 142.5f, -88.2f, 0xABCDE12345 };
// Pass your custom data type into the template slotEnclaveSDK::ProtectedVariable<GameServerData> secure_matrix;
// Bind the container to activate microsecond memory shuffling
secure_matrix.BindToEnclaveCore(&raw_data);

------------------------------
## 🏎️ Step 4: Interact with Data via Safe Getters and Setters
To prevent application page faults, you must never reference or pointer-scrape wrapped variables directly. Interact with your secure memory enclaves exclusively through thread-safe atomic getters and setters:
## To Read Secure Values:
When you invoke .Get(), the SDK reads from the isolated CPU register cache, un-scrambling the layout for a microsecond fraction to give you a pristine snapshot without exposing the raw RAM structure to external attackers:

GameServerData live_snapshot = secure_matrix.Get();std::cout << "Active Player: " << live_snapshot.player_id << "\n";

## To Update Secure Values:
When you alter parameters, modify your snapshot copy and push it back using .Set(). The Polymorphic Sync Engine immediately intercepts the memory footprint, shuffling its physical RAM offsets based on the machine's true hardware RDRAND entropy:

GameServerData updated_snapshot = secure_matrix.Get();
updated_snapshot.position_x += 5.5f; // Modify a parameter

secure_matrix.Set(updated_snapshot); // Re-scramble across physical RAM instantly

------------------------------
## 🔨 Step 5: Adapt Your Compiler Build Configuration
To compile your application cleanly alongside our integration templates, you must update your local build project variables to support the C++20 Standard or higher.
## If building with CMake (CMakeLists.txt):
Add these configuration lines right below your project declaration to enforce C++20 standard requirements and turn off unsafe runtime code RTTI expansions:

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
if(MSVC)
    add_compile_options(/W4 /WX /GR- /EHs-c- /GS-)else()
    add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Werror -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions)endif()
# Link your app binary targetsadd_executable(my_protected_game src/main.cpp)

## If building with Visual Studio (Windows Desktop):

   1. Right-click your application project in the Solution Explorer and select Properties.
   2. Navigate to Configuration Properties > General.
   3. Locate C++ Language Standard and change the drop-down to ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20).
   4. Navigate to C/C++ > Language and set Enable Run-Time Type Information to No (/GR-).
   5. Click Apply and select Build Solution. [3] 

------------------------------
## 📡 Step 6: Multi-Machine Cross-Platform Network Sync (Optional)
If your app requires passing these secure variable states to a remote computer over the network wire:

* For Standard Network Cards: Make sure your client/server code compiles using the Enclave-Core-Network-Temp branch. When your networking sockets prepare to blast outbound bytes, invoke our transit wrapper:

ExecuteSoftwareNetworkSync(raw_bytes, size, encrypted_output_buffer);

Our hypervisor server layer will instantly wrap the payload inside an out-of-band 50ms rolling epoch cipher, allowing your normal network card to transmit it safely across public internet channels without introducing a single millisecond of execution lag.
------------------------------
## 🌐 Step 7: Multi-Machine Deployments (Game Client/Server & File Sharing)
Project Enclave natively supports secure, real-time data synchronization between separate physical computers (e.g., a high-performance game server talking to multiple secure desktop clients, or decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing arrays).
## 1. How It Works: Preventing Memory-Scrambling Confusion
Every machine running our hypervisor generates its own isolated, unique g_DynamicMutationKey based strictly on its local physical CPU silicon footprint (CPUID). Consequently, Computer A and Server B scramble their local RAM layout using completely different mathematical universe patterns.
To prevent memory translation confusion across the network wire, the SDK handles data via Normalized Transit Serialization:

   1. Local Unwrapping: When Computer A invokes secure_matrix.Get(), the SDK reads the data into the local CPU registers, automatically normalizing the structured payload into a standard raw binary byte array for a microsecond.
   2. Transit Shielding: The binary array is passed down to ExecuteSoftwareNetworkSync(). The hypervisor wraps this raw blob inside an independent, shared AES-256-GCM network transit envelope that rotates cryptographic keys every 50 milliseconds, stamping an unencrypted Epoch ID tag onto the packet header.
   3. Remote Ingestion: When the packet lands at Server B, its own running hypervisor extracts the Epoch ID, checks its 3-Slot Sliding Window Cache, pulls the correct network key, and converts the packet back into the standard raw binary blob.
   4. Target Re-Scrambling: Server B passes the clean binary blob up to its application layer, where .Set() instantly intercepts the memory footprint and scrambles the data across Server B's local RAM chips using Server B's unique hardware keys. Both local hardware profiles remain 100% air-gapped and anonymous.

## 2. Implementation How-To: Compiling a Client/Server Pipeline
To configure a multi-machine project, structure your network loop to handle data packets using the following exact code sequences:
## A. The Sender Routine (e.g., The Client pushing an action update)

// 1. Grab a clean snapshot of your local protected data structureGameServerData current_state = secure_matrix.Get();
// 2. Establish your network transport outbound bufferssize_t payload_size = sizeof(GameServerData);size_t total_packet_size = payload_size + 8; // Size + 8-byte Epoch metadata headeruint8_t* outbound_wire_buffer = new uint8_t[total_packet_size];
// 3. Invoke the hypervisor transport engine to encrypt the frame for standard NICs// Casts local structure to a raw binary transit format
ExecuteSoftwareNetworkSync(reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(&current_state), payload_size, outbound_wire_buffer);
// 4. Pass the outbound_wire_buffer directly to your standard socket handler (e.g., send())// Your normal network card transmits the encrypted noise safely over the internet
send(client_socket, outbound_wire_buffer, total_packet_size, 0);
delete[] outbound_wire_buffer;

## B. The Receiver Routine (e.g., The Server parsing the incoming packet)

// 1. Allocate your incoming network stream network bufferssize_t payload_size = sizeof(GameServerData);size_t total_packet_size = payload_size + 8;uint8_t* incoming_wire_buffer = new uint8_t[total_packet_size];
// 2. Receive the packet from your standard network socket stream
recv(server_socket, incoming_wire_buffer, total_packet_size, 0);
// 3. Initialize your clean local target memory buffer blockGameServerData received_state;
// 4. Pass to the 3-slot sliding window cache loop to instantly decode the frame// This safely strips the transit wrapper and populates your clean memory bufferbool sync_valid = ProcessIncomingFrame(incoming_wire_buffer, payload_size, reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(&received_state));
if (sync_valid) {
    // 5. Instantly pass the clean data to the local target matrix
    // This triggers an immediate local scramble using the server's unique CPU keys
    secure_matrix.Set(received_state);
} else {
    std::cerr << "[MALICIOUS PACKET] Network synchronization dropped or corrupted.\n";
}
delete[] incoming_wire_buffer;

By keeping network encryption and local memory mutation completely decentralized, your architecture scales smoothly to support thousands of active client machines talking to a master server cluster without introducing thread contention, memory-scrambling conflicts, or processing lag.
